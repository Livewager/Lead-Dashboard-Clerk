-- ========================================
-- FIX RLS POLICIES FOR IMMEDIATE FUNCTIONALITY
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor to fix the "Failed to claim" errors
-- ========================================

-- Drop existing restrictive policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "clinic can create claim" ON public.lead_claims;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "clinic can read own claims" ON public.lead_claims;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "can update lead status on claim" ON public.leads;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "clinic can create self" ON public.clinics;

-- Temporarily allow all authenticated users to perform operations
-- (In production, you'd want stricter policies with proper JWT claims)

-- Allow any authenticated user to create a clinic profile
CREATE POLICY "authenticated users can create clinic"
  ON public.clinics FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (true);

-- Allow any authenticated user to create claims
CREATE POLICY "authenticated users can create claims"
  ON public.lead_claims FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (true);

-- Allow any authenticated user to read all claims
CREATE POLICY "authenticated users can read claims"
  ON public.lead_claims FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (true);

-- Allow updating lead status to claimed
CREATE POLICY "authenticated users can claim leads"
  ON public.leads FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING (status = 'available')
  WITH CHECK (status IN ('available', 'claimed', 'being_claimed'));

-- Done! Now try claiming a lead again.
